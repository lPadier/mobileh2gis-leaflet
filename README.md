## An example of a project using the phonegap h2gis plugin

### How to use:
First create a new phonegap project by using 'phonegap create  path-to-app' 
And then copying the contents of this repositry into path-to-app

Then run: "phonegap build android" or "phonegap run android"

Also this project is not complete, the javascript was used in a chrome view debug mode.
